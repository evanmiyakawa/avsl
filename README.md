This is a repository containing the latest AVSL team ratings, which you can find in `ratings.csv`. 

Additionally, you can simulate AVSL game probabilities using the R script `main.R`. You will need to install the `dplyr` and `janitor` packages first. 

`install.packages(c("dplyr", "janitor"))`

Simulate one game by putting in two team names as the function arguments to `sim_one_game()`, such as `sim_one_game("Bowlero", "Lama Dog")`.
